# Movie_Recommendation_System
This project implements a basic movie recommendation system using user-based collaborative filtering. It leverages the MovieLens dataset to suggest movies based on ratings from similar users. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, the system computes user similarity via cosine distance and outputs personalized movie recommendations.
